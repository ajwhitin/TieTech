# TieTech: Surgical Methods Practice and Assessment Device
**Engineers**: Zach Knauss, Renee Miller, Geoff VanSickle, Alexis Whitinger 

**Sponsor**: Nick Anton, MS

**About the Project**

TieTech is a device that is used to aid in the teaching and assessment of health care providers and students who use surgical knot tying. This device provides real time tension display and quantitative data! The device is control via a user interface designed in MATLAB App designer. Its key features include: 
- Start/Stop button
- Export/save button
- Balance button
- Real time data plots
- Real time data conversion

**Getting Started and Usage**

To run via MATLAB:
1. download the TieTech_A_Final_Draft.mlapp
2. instal arduino MATLAB Support Package for Arduino Hardware
3. Open up TieTech_A_Final_Draft.mlapp in MATLAB app designer
4. Plug in arduino Uno into computer
5. Press green start arrow
6.Once UI appears enter the date, desired file name, click balance, and then click start
7. Collect data and then click stop
8.Press export button to save data

**Future Updates**

The user inteface is currently being developed into a standalone application that would be able to be used without the operating computure needing MATLAB. Check back soon for information on how to access this application.
